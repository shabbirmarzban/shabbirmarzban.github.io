[Steps]
> 1. Think of something it would be worthwhile to do right now, without any expectation that you know what might be "best". (And don't forget that it could be "take a nap"!)

> 2. Write it down.

> 3. Do that thing. 
>
> 4. Cross it out.
> 
> 5. Go back to 1., writing the next thing underneath the one you just crossed out. Repeat (forever).

> And just to spell it out: the point here isn't "stop multitasking and focus on one thing, and you're a bad person if you don't!" Rather, it's that (with a few technical exceptions) you never actually are multitasking to begin with. Instead, you're just anxiously switching your attention rapidly between things â€“ because you're not sure which one's more urgent, and/or because you think you'll get them done quicker that way, which is almost never true.
